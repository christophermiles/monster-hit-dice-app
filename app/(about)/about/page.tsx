      <h1>What is this?</h1>

      <p>
        This Monster Hit Dice App takes a Hit Dice expression (thatâ€™s a fancy
        way of saying â€˜number of Hit Dice of a certain Hit Dice type plus
        modifiersâ€™) and generates Hit Point values ranging between{' '}
        <strong>minimum</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>average</strong>, <strong>strong</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>maximum</strong> &mdash; with weak being halfway between minimum
        and average, and strong being halfway between average and maximum.
      </p>

      <h2>But why?</h2>

      <p>
        Using a creatureâ€™s average Hit Points works just fine for most Dungeons
        &amp; Dragons combats.
      </p>
      <p>
        But sometimes you might want to give your{' '}
        <abbr title="Big Bad Evil Guy">BBEG ðŸ˜ˆ</abbr> the maximum possible Hit
        Points for their creature type and you donâ€™t want to do the maths
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe youâ€™re using multiple creatures of the same type in a battle, but
        you want to mix things up a bit. Like, maybe you want some of your
        kobolds to be even weaker than average &mdash; but you want{' '}
        <em>some</em> of them to be <strong>ðŸ’ªKOBOLD CHADâ„¢ðŸ’ªs</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe you just want to tweak a creatureâ€™s Hit Points mid-battle.
        Sacrilege? Heresy? The most condemnable example of referee fiat
        imaginable? Well,{' '}
