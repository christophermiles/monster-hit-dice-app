# Monster Hit Dice

An app for generating a range of Hit Point values from Dungeons &amp; Dragons Hit Dice expressions.

---

## Wait, what is this?

This Monster Hit Dice web app takes a Hit Dice expression (thatâ€™s a fancy way of saying â€˜number of Hit Dice of a certain Hit Dice type plus modifiersâ€™) and generates Hit Point values ranging between **minimum**, **weak**, **average**, **strong** and **maximum** &mdash; with weak being halfway between minimum and average, and strong being halfway between average and maximum.

### But why?

Using a creatureâ€™s average Hit Points works just fine for most Dungeons & Dragons combats.

But sometimes you might want to give your <abbr title="Big Bad Evil Guy ðŸ˜ˆ">BBEG</abbr> the maximum possible Hit Points for their creature type and you donâ€™t want to do the maths yourself.

Maybe youâ€™re using multiple creatures of the same type in a battle, but you want to mix things up a bit. Like, maybe you want some of your kobolds to be even weaker than average &mdash; but you want *one* of them to be a **ðŸ’ªKOBOLD CHADâ„¢ðŸ’ª**.

Or maybe you just want to tweak a creatureâ€™s Hit Points mid-battle. Sacrilege? Heresy? The most condemnable example of referee fiat one could possibly imagine? Well, [hereâ€™s Mike Shea at Sly Flourish with some perfectly valid reasons why we might want to do this](https://slyflourish.com/tweaking_monster_hit_points.html)!

### Monster Hit Dice API

A public API for calculating Hit Point values from Hit Dice expressions is available at [api.monsterhitdice.app](https://api.monsterhitdice.app)

For example:

```shell
  curl --request GET \<br />
  --url
  &#39;https://api.monsterhitdice.app/hp?hd=2d8-2&hd=2d8+6&hd=8d10+40&hd=33d20+330&#39;
```

Or try it from your browser: [api.monsterhitdice.app/hp?hd=2d8-2&hd=2d8+6&hd=8d10+40&hd=33d20+330](https://api.monsterhitdice.app/hp?hd=2d8-2&hd=2d8+6&hd=8d10+40&hd=33d20+330)
